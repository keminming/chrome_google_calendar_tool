    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>
      Calendar++ aims to provide a faster way of adding new event to google calendar.
	  It allows you to add new event by right click the content menu. It also
      nicely displays all the events in your google calendar and you can easily modify or delete event from 
	  the popup page.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick start</h2>
    <p>
      When you open a web page for example your gmail account. And you find some important time such as 
	  your interview day or UPS pick up day. You can just hight light the text containing the time information(y/m/d am/pm time zone), then right click the web page and choose the "add to calendar"
	  on the context menu. The Calendar++ will automatically parse the time and if the format is recognized it will 
	  prompt you to enter the event title. Later it will create a new event through the google caldendar API.
	  Then a success message will showed to confirm your operation. You can easily check the result by opening the popup 
	  page. On this page, all the events on your google calendar will be listed from most recent one to old ones. You can
	  then modify/delete these events in place on the popup page instead of login to your google calendar account.
	  
	  The number showed on the icon indicate the number of event coming today.
